  'Quantum L7 AI is not just a platform but an entire cybernetic universe of decision-making: institutional-grade multichain data, autonomous L7 agents, on-chain pipelines, and trading routing operate as a single digital organism. We connect the Web-MiniApp, Telegram MiniApp and QL7 AI Bot, a forum with the QCoin economy, and a global exchange ( core in the final stage ) to provide instant alpha signals, disciplined entry/exit windows, automated execution, and a transparent risk perimeter. Authorization is via non-custodial wallets (keys stay with you), support for PRO/VIP tiers, priority limits, and quota removal. At the core is a legally vetted Web3 architecture, cross-exchange liquidity aggregation, behavioral and microstructural models, as well as replicable research pipelines with the log hypothesis → test → evidence. This is next-generation infrastructure for those who work at market pace and require provability, speed, and accuracy.',

    paras: [
      `Quantum L7 AI is a cross-platform ecosystem: the AI core, autonomous L7 agents, on-chain monitoring, normalized market feeds, the forum social network, and the QCoin economy are combined into a single computational fabric. Every artifact — a transaction, a news narrative, a post, a liquidity chart — enters the common data loop and becomes a call to action.`,
      `L7 agents autonomously read documents and APIs, observe blockchains and order books, classify behavioral patterns, assess market regimes, and produce verifiable hypotheses. The result is not a “black box” but an explainable card: scenario probability, amplitude, horizons, SL/TP, confidence factors, and links to primary sources.`,
      `Authorization is via non-custodial wallets: we do not store private keys and only confirm ownership of the address. Access rights and quotas are synchronized between the Telegram MiniApp, the web interface, and the QL7 bot; VIP status marks the boundaries of limits and lets you into priority processing channels.`,
      `The market core is built on cross-exchange aggregation, unification of symbols/contracts, and latency-aware feed processing. We combine institution-level histories with real-time streams to track spread dispersion, shock volumes, order balance, MEV risks, and the effect of the news impulse.`,
      `The platform principle is provability: hypothesis → test → evidence. Every computation is logged, metrics are reproducible, and “noise” arbitrage is cut off by regime filters. This is how we turn raw data into disciplined decisions and intuition into verifiable tactics.`,
      `The forum is embedded into the loop: content passes AI scoring (quality, engagement, anti-spam/anti-sybil), and activity is mapped into the QCoin economy. This is not a “social network for likes” but a targeted cognitive bus where knowledge and contribution are converted into tokenized value.`,

/* ===== ABOUT ===== */
about_title: 'About Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI is not just “analytics” — it is an integrated operational framework for making trading decisions and enabling social interaction around crypto markets. The platform’s core unites Web-MiniApp (web + Telegram), forums with gamified QCoin mining, and an AI research engine that filters noise, reveals liquidity structures, and suggests disciplined entry/exit scenarios. We combine market microstructure, on-chain telemetry, behavioral patterns, and news narratives into one coherent, interpretable layer — so you don’t have to “chase” the market but can design your moves in advance.`,

  `L7 agents are applied AI modules that live on data. They read documents and feeds, query APIs, observe blockchains, order books, and derivatives, run mini-experiments, and produce explainable artifacts: hypotheses, backtest snapshots, contextual indicators. The focus is not on the “black box magic,” but on traceability: from each conclusion, the path is visible — which features were considered (liquidity, spreads, asymmetry, imbalances, impulses, volume clusters), why weight was reduced in thin/manipulated zones, and where the boundary of scenario invalidation lies.`,

  `Who it’s for. For traders — fast situational awareness and manageable signal frequency without overload; for researchers — reproducible pipelines and clean data; for teams — API/SDK, webhooks, and a reliable event bus; for the builder community — forums, reputation metrics, and the QCoin economy for contributions. VIP+ receives a priority AI channel, media posting, accelerated quotas, and a “gold” status that affects ranking and limits.`,

  `Coverage. We aggregate data from leading CEXs and DEX aggregators, normalize symbols and contract metadata, unify tick frequencies and order book depth. We introduce unified directories, mappings of pairs/networks/markets, tag derivatives, and account for splits, delistings, and contract migrations. The goal is comparability across platforms and networks: a single abstraction layer to compare liquidity, costs, latency, and the “real” availability of volumes.`,

  `Data pipeline. Streams are cleaned, gaps are restored, anomalies are tagged, and delay contours are calibrated. The history is deep — this allows detection of regimes instead of chasing random spikes. We add on-chain routes, bridge transfers, holder distributions, MEV activity markers, and link them with market metrics. The result — feature ensembles resistant to “noise bubbles” and local anomalies.`,

  `Analytical core. Hundreds of indicators are merely a palette. The essence is in ensembles and context: RSI/RSX, Stochastic, CCI/MFI, ADX/DI, ATR and bands, EMA/SMA/WMA, MACD/Signal/Histogram, VWAP/POC/Value-Area, volume profiles, Bid/Ask imbalances, and liquidity sweeps. We blend classical families with regime filters, liquidity and behavioral heuristics, and on-chain inflow/outflow markers. Each card is not a “tip,” but a compass: amplitude through history, realization horizon, confidence, prerequisites, and invalidation boundaries.`,

  `On-chain modules. We track transfer clusters, bridges, accumulation/distribution, large holder concentration, basic MEV patterns, and anomalous routes. In thin liquidity zones, during funding or spread spikes, signal weights decrease; when confirmed by several domains (spot, derivatives, on-chain) — they increase. This minimizes “false confidence” where the market is fragile.`,

  `Narratives and news. The multilingual feed is translated, deduplicated, and indexed by embeddings. We evaluate novelty, source credibility, the ratio of “ritual/substance,” tone, and thematic persistence over time. Alongside price and on-chain metrics, a light “narrative map” emerges: what drives attention, where regulatory risks appear, what amplifies volatility, and what fades away.`,

  `Signal cards and discipline. Each card contains expected amplitude (quantiles), time horizon, SL/TP markers, a quick liquidity summary, and a set of triggers that must align. The system promotes discipline: before entry, you see invalidation, risk unit, and a dynamic volatility corridor; after entry — you receive validation checkpoints and risk removal conditions.`,

  `Architecture. Lightweight TypeScript/Python services behind a stable API; the website runs on Next.js with live layers via WebSocket. Cache layers and fallback sources ensure graceful degradation during peaks. API/SDK and webhooks enable automation, while roles and audit enforce secure boundaries. MiniApp works in web and Telegram so you can manage the market in one flow: charts, forum, wallet, bot — without friction.`,

  `Security and privacy. Non-custodial: we do not request or store private keys/seeds. Roles restrict access, actions are logged, personal data is minimized and encrypted in transit and at rest. Anti-sybil/anti-fraud pipelines protect the QCoin economy and the forum’s reputation mechanics; session validation is gentle yet strict, maintaining access integrity.`,

  `Forum and QCoin mining. The forum is not a “social network,” but a production line of knowledge. Every 4 hours, you confirm activity and lock in rewards; posts with media (video/images/audio) go through Quantum L7 AI scoring (quality, engagement, anti-spam/anti-sybil) and are converted into QCoin. VIP+ receives X2 in time and X2 in quests, priority in ranking, extended media limits, and accelerated moderation. Reputation and contribution are not empty noise but economically meaningful values.`,

  `Exchange (in development) and recommendations. The trading core and execution are being connected step by step; AI-based recommendations by symbols/timeframes, order book depth, and liquidity profiles are already available. We are designing smart routing, delay/slippage protection, portfolio constraints, and PnL attribution. VIP+ gains access to experimental indicators, what-if/backtest modes, and extended analytical horizons.`,

  `QCoin economy and L7 blockchain. QCoin is the fuel of knowledge and productive traffic. The upcoming L7-chain is a layer that connects cross-network assets, banks, and financial infrastructure into a universal value router. Our goal is for QCoin to become a neutral settlement unit within the ecosystem, with transparent issuance/burning and a fair withdrawal queue. VIP+ enjoys higher priority in distributions and early access to staking/validator roles.`,

  `Payment and activation. The VIP+ subscription is processed via NowPayments: crypto payment (USDT and others), webhook instantly activates access and synchronizes status across MiniApp, bot, and forum. No screenshots or manual checks. The interface is available in 7 languages; wallet linking is seamless. You pay for speed, interpretability, and an economy where contribution is rewarded.`,

  `Community and roadmap. We publish weekly notes, open alpha-feature betas, and accept targeted requests from teams. In the backlog: a portfolio engine with risk budgets, extended CEX/DEX smart routing, public notebooks/backtests, and a “semi-autopilot” under human supervision. Everything that enhances discipline and reduces friction goes to release; what merely glitters but doesn’t help — doesn’t. Materials are educational/analytical, not financial advice.`

  'Quantum L7 AI — это не просто платформа, а целая кибернетическая вселенная принятия решений: мультичейн-данные институционального класса, автономные L7-агенты, ончейн-пайплайны и торговая маршрутизация работают как единый цифровой организм. Мы стыкуем Web-MiniApp, Telegram MiniApp и QL7 AI Bot, форум с экономикой QCoin и глобальную биржу ( ядро в финальной стадии ), чтобы дать мгновочные альфа-сигналы, дисциплинированные окна входа/выхода, автоматизированное исполнение и прозрачный риск-контур. Авторизация — через некостодиальные кошельки (ключи у вас), поддержка PRO/VIP-уровней, приоритетные лимиты и снятие квот. В основе — юридически выверенная архитектура Web3, кросс-эксчендж-агрегация ликвидности, поведенческие и микроструктурные модели, а также реплицируемые ресёрч-пайплайны с логом гипотеза → тест → свидетельства. Это инфраструктура нового поколения для тех, кто работает в темпе рынка и требует доказуемости, скорости и точности.',

Каждый артефакт — транзакция, новостной нарратив, пост, график ликвидности — попадает в общий контур данных и становится сигналом к действию.`,
      `Агенты L7 автономно читают документы и API, наблюдают блокчейны и стаканы, классифицируют поведенческие паттерны, оценивают режимы рынка и выводят проверяемые гипотезы. Результат — не «чёрный ящик», а объяснимая карточка: вероятность сценария, амплитуда, горизонты, SL/TP, факторы уверенности и ссылки на первоисточники.`,

      `Форум встраивается в контур: контент проходит AI-скоринг (качество, вовлечённость, анти-спам/anti-sybil), а активность маппится в экономику QCoin. Это не «соцсеть ради лайков», а целевая когнитивная шина, где знания и вклад конвертируются в токенизированную ценность.`,

/* ===== ABOUT ===== */
about_title: 'О Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI — это не просто «аналитика», а единый операционный контур принятия торговых решений и социального взаимодействия вокруг крипто-рынков. Ядро платформы объединяет Web-MiniApp (веб + Telegram), форумы с геймифицированным QCoin-майнингом и ИИ-ресёрч-движок, который снимает шум, выявляет структуру ликвидности и подсказывает дисциплинированные сценарии входа/выхода. Мы соединяем рыночную микро-структуру, ончейн-телееметрию, поведенческие паттерны и новостные нарративы в один согласованный, интерпретируемый слой — так, чтобы вам не приходилось «догонять» рынок, а можно было проектировать ход заранее.`,

  `L7-агенты — это прикладные ИИ-модули, которые живут на данных. Они читают документы и ленты, запрашивают API, наблюдают блокчейны, стаканы и деривативы, прогоняют мини-эксперименты и выдают объяснимые артефакты: гипотезы, бэктест-снапшоты, контекстные индикаторы. Важна не «магия чёрного ящика», а трассируемость: из каждого вывода виден путь — какие признаки были учтены (ликвидность, спрэды, асимметрия, дисбалансы, импульсы, кластера объёмов), почему понижен вес в тонких/манипулируемых зонах и где проходит граница невалидности сценария.`,

  `Для кого это. Трейдерам — быстрая ситуационная осведомлённость и управляемая частота сигналов без перегруза; исследователям — воспроизводимые пайплайны и чистые данные; командам — API/SDK, вебхуки и надёжная шина событий; билдер-сообществу — форумы, репутационные метрики и QCoin-экономика за вклад. VIP+ получает приоритетный ИИ-канал, медиапостинг, ускоренные квоты и «золотой» статус, который влияет на выдачу и лимиты.`,

  `Покрытие. Мы агрегируем данные с ведущих CEX и DEX-агрегаторов, нормализуем символы и контракт-метаданные, унифицируем частоты тиков и глубину стаканов. Вводим единые справочники, мэппинги пар/сетей/маркетов, помечаем деривативы, учитываем сплиты, делистинги и миграции контрактов. Цель — сопоставимость площадок и сетей: один слой абстракции, чтобы сравнивать ликвидность, издержки, задержки и «реальную» доступность объёмов.`,

  `Пайплайн данных. Потоки очищаются, пропуски реставрируются, аномалии маркируются, контуры задержек калибруются. История глубока — это даёт возможность выявлять режимы, а не натягивать указку на случайный всплеск. Мы добавляем ончейн-маршруты, переводные мосты, распределения держателей, признаки MEV-активности и связываем это с рыночными метриками. Итог — ансамбли признаков, устойчивые к «пузырям шума» и локальным аномалиям.`,

  `Аналитическое ядро. Сотни индикаторов — лишь палитра. Главное — ансамбли и контекст: RSI/RSX, Stochastic, CCI/MFI, ADX/DI, ATR и полосы, EMA/SMA/WMA, MACD/Signal/Histogram, VWAP/POC/Value-Area, объёмные профили, дисбалансы Bid/Ask и свипы ликвидности. Мы смешиваем классические семейства с фильтрами режимов, евристиками по ликвидности и поведению, а также с ончейн-маркером притока/оттока. Каждая карточка — это не «совет», а компас: амплитуда по истории, горизонт реализации, уверенность, предпосылки и границы инвалидации.`,

  `Ончейн-модули. Мы отслеживаем переводные кластера, мосты, накопление/распределение, концентрацию крупных держателей, базовые MEV-паттерны и аномальные маршруты. В тонких зонах ликвидности, при всплесках фандинга или спрэда вес сигналов снижается; при подтверждении несколькими доменами (спот, деривативы, ончейн) — повышается. Так минимизируется «ложная уверенность» там, где рынок хрупок.`,

  `Нарративы и новости. Мультиязычная лента переводится, дедуплицируется и индексируется по эмбеддингам. Мы оцениваем новизну, доверие источника, соотношение «ритуал/суть», тональность и «тягучесть» темы во времени. Рядом с ценовыми и ончейн-метриками появляется лёгкая «карта нарратива»: чем драйвится внимание, где регуляторные риски, что усиливает волатильность, а что сдувается.`,

  `Карточки сигналов и дисциплина. На карточке — ожидаемая амплитуда (квантили), временной горизонт, SL/TP-маркеры, быстрая сводка ликвидности и набор триггеров, которые должны сойтись. Система подталкивает к дисциплине: до входа вы видите инвалидацию, риск-единицу и динамический коридор волатильности; после — получаете проверочные чек-поинты и условия снятия риска.`,

  `Архитектура. Лёгкие сервисы на TypeScript/Python за стабильным API; сайт — на Next.js с живыми слоями через WebSocket. Кэш-уровни и резервные источники обеспечивают плавную деградацию в пиках. API/SDK и вебхуки дают автоматизацию, а роли и аудит — безопасные границы. MiniApp работает в вебе и в Telegram, чтобы вы могли вести рынок в одном потоке: графики, форум, кошелёк, бот — без трения.`,

  `Безопасность и приватность. Некостодиально: приватные ключи/seed не запрашиваем и не храним. Роли ограничивают доступ, действия логируются, персональные данные минимизируются и шифруются в передаче и хранении. Анти-sybil/anti-fraud пайплайны защищают экономику QCoin и репутационные механики форума; валидация сессий бережно, но строго поддерживает целостность доступа.`,

  `Форум и QCoin-майнинг. Форум — это не «соцсеть», а производственная линия знаний. Каждые 4 часа вы подтверждаете активность и лочите награду; посты с медиа (видео/изображения/аудио) проходят скоринг Quantum L7 AI (качество, вовлечённость, анти-спам/анти-sybil) и конвертятся в QCoin. VIP+ получает X2 по времени и X2 по квестам, приоритет в выдаче, расширенные лимиты на медиа и ускоренную модерацию. Репутация и вклад — не пустой шум, а экономически значимая величина.`,

  `Биржа (в разработке) и рекомендации. Торговое ядро и исполнение подключаются поэтапно; уже доступны ИИ-рекомендации по символам/таймфреймам, глубина стакана и профиль ликвидности. Мы проектируем smart-routing, защиту от задержек/проскальзывания, портфельные ограничения и атрибуцию PnL. VIP+ получает доступ к экспериментальным индикаторам, режимам what-if/backtest и расширенным горизонтам анализа.`,

  `Экономика QCoin и L7-блокчейн. QCoin — топливо знаний и полезного трафика. Будущий L7-chain — это слой, который связывает кросс-сетевые активы, банки и фин-инфраструктуру в универсальный маршрутизатор ценности. Наша цель — чтобы QCoin стал нейтральной расчётной единицей в экосистеме, с прозрачной эмиссией/сжиганием и честной очередью вывода. VIP+ имеет повышенный приоритет на распределения и ранний доступ к стейкингу/валидаторским ролям.`,

  `Оплата и активация. Подписка VIP+ оформляется через NowPayments: крипто-оплата (USDT и др.), вебхук мгновенно активирует доступ и синхронизирует статус между MiniApp, ботом и форумом. Никаких скриншотов и ручных проверок. Интерфейс доступен на 7 языках; связка кошелька — бесшовная. Вы платите за скорость, интерпретируемость и экономику, в которой вклад вознаграждается.`,

  `Комьюнити и дорожная карта. Мы публикуем еженедельные заметки, открываем беты альфа-фич, принимаем целевые запросы от команд. В бэклоге: портфельный движок с риск-бюджетами, расширенная смарт-маршрутизация CEX/DEX, публичные ноутбуки/бэктесты, «полуавтопилот» под контролем человека. Всё, что повышает дисциплину и снижает трение, идёт в релиз; то, что блестит, но не помогает — нет. Материалы — образовательные/аналитические, не финсовет.`

Кожен артефакт — транзакція, новинний наратив, пост, графік ліквідності — потрапляє в загальний контур даних і стає сигналом до дії.`,
      `Агенти L7 автономно читають документи й API, спостерігають блокчейни та стакани, класифікують поведінкові патерни, оцінюють режими ринку та формують перевірювані гіпотези. Результат — не «чорна скринька», а пояснювана картка: імовірність сценарію, амплітуда, горизонти, SL/TP, фактори впевненості та посилання на першоджерела.`,

about_title: 'Про Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI — це не просто «аналітика», а єдиний операційний контур ухвалення торговельних рішень і соціальної взаємодії навколо крипторинків. Ядро платформи об’єднує Web-MiniApp (веб + Telegram), форуми з гейміфікованим майнінгом QCoin і ІІ-ресерч-рушій, який прибирає шум, виявляє структуру ліквідності та підказує дисципліновані сценарії входу/виходу. Ми поєднуємо ринкову мікроструктуру, ончейн-телеметрію, поведінкові патерни та новинні наративи в один узгоджений, інтерпретований шар — так, щоб вам не доводилося «наздоганяти» ринок, а можна було проєктувати хід заздалегідь.`,

  `L7-агенти — це прикладні ІІ-модулі, які живуть на даних. Вони читають документи та стрічки, запитують API, спостерігають блокчейни, стакани й деривативи, проганяють мініексперименти та видають пояснювані артефакти: гіпотези, бектест-снепшоти, контекстні індикатори. Важлива не «магія чорної скриньки», а трасованість: із кожного висновку видно шлях — які ознаки було враховано (ліквідність, спреди, асиметрія, дисбаланси, імпульси, кластери обсягів), чому знижено вагу в тонких/маніпульованих зонах і де проходить межа невалідності сценарію.`,

  `Для кого це. Трейдерам — швидка ситуаційна обізнаність і керована частота сигналів без перевантаження; дослідникам — відтворювані пайплайни та чисті дані; командам — API/SDK, вебхуки й надійна шина подій; білдер-спільноті — форуми, репутаційні метрики та економіка QCoin за внесок. VIP+ отримує пріоритетний ІІ-канал, медіапостинг, пришвидшені квоти та «золотий» статус, який впливає на видачу й ліміти.`,

  `Покриття. Ми агрегуємо дані з провідних CEX і DEX-агрегаторів, нормалізуємо символи й контракт-метадані, уніфікуємо частоти тіків і глибину стаканів. Уводимо єдині довідники, мепінги пар/мереж/ринків, позначаємо деривативи, враховуємо спліти, делістинги та міграції контрактів. Мета — співставність майданчиків і мереж: один шар абстракції, щоб порівнювати ліквідність, витрати, затримки та «реальну» доступність обсягів.`,

  `Пайплайн даних. Потоки очищуються, пропуски відновлюються, аномалії маркуються, контури затримок калібруються. Історія глибока — це дає змогу виявляти режими, а не натягувати вказівник на випадковий сплеск. Ми додаємо ончейн-маршрути, переказні мости, розподіли тримачів, ознаки MEV-активності та пов’язуємо це з ринковими метриками. Підсумок — ансамблі ознак, стійкі до «бульбашок шуму» й локальних аномалій.`,

  `Аналітичне ядро. Сотні індикаторів — лише палітра. Головне — ансамблі та контекст: RSI/RSX, Stochastic, CCI/MFI, ADX/DI, ATR і смуги, EMA/SMA/WMA, MACD/Signal/Histogram, VWAP/POC/Value-Area, об’ємні профілі, дисбаланси Bid/Ask і свіпи ліквідності. Ми змішуємо класичні сімейства з фільтрами режимів, евристиками з ліквідності та поведінки, а також з ончейн-маркером притоку/відтоку. Кожна картка — це не «порада», а компас: амплітуда за історією, горизонт реалізації, упевненість, передумови та межі інвалідації.`,

  `Ончейн-модулі. Ми відстежуємо переказні кластери, мости, накопичення/розподіл, концентрацію великих тримачів, базові MEV-патерни та аномальні маршрути. У тонких зонах ліквідності, за сплесків фондінгу чи спреду вага сигналів знижується; за підтвердження кількома доменами (спот, деривативи, ончейн) — підвищується. Так мінімізується «хибна впевненість» там, де ринок крихкий.`,

  `Наративи та новини. Багатомовна стрічка перекладається, дедуплікується й індексується за ембедингами. Ми оцінюємо новизну, довіру до джерела, співвідношення «ритуал/сутність», тональність і «липкість» теми в часі. Поруч із ціновими та ончейн-метриками з’являється легка «карта наративу»: чим драйвиться увага, де регуляторні ризики, що підсилює волатильність, а що здувається.`,

  `Картки сигналів і дисципліна. На картці — очікувана амплітуда (квантілі), часовий горизонт, SL/TP-маркери, швидка зведена з ліквідності та набір тригерів, які мають зійтися. Система підштовхує до дисципліни: до входу ви бачите інвалідацію, ризик-одиницю й динамічний коридор волатильності; після — отримуєте перевірочні чек-поінти та умови зняття ризику.`,

  `Архітектура. Легкі сервіси на TypeScript/Python за стабільним API; сайт — на Next.js із живими шарами через WebSocket. Кеш-рівні та резервні джерела забезпечують плавну деградацію в піках. API/SDK і вебхуки дають автоматизацію, а ролі й аудит — безпечні межі. MiniApp працює у вебі й у Telegram, щоб ви могли вести ринок в одному потоці: графіки, форум, гаманець, бот — без тертя.`,

  `Безпека та приватність. Некостодіально: приватні ключі/seed не запитуємо й не зберігаємо. Ролі обмежують доступ, дії логуються, персональні дані мінімізуються та шифруються під час передавання і зберігання. Anti-sybil/anti-fraud пайплайни захищають економіку QCoin і репутаційні механіки форуму; валідація сесій дбайливо, але суворо підтримує цілісність доступу.`,

  `Форум і майнінг QCoin. Форум — це не «соцмережа», а виробнича лінія знань. Кожні 4 години ви підтверджуєте активність і фіксуєте винагороду; пости з медіа (відео/зображення/аудіо) проходять скоринг Quantum L7 AI (якість, залученість, анти-спам/anti-sybil) і конвертуються в QCoin. VIP+ отримує X2 за часом і X2 за квестами, пріоритет у видачі, розширені ліміти на медіа та пришвидшену модерацію. Репутація і внесок — не порожній шум, а економічно значуща величина.`,

  `Біржа (в розробці) і рекомендації. Торговельне ядро та виконання під’єднуються поетапно; уже доступні ІІ-рекомендації за символами/таймфреймами, глибина стакана й профіль ліквідності. Ми проєктуємо smart-routing, захист від затримок/прослизання, портфельні обмеження й атрибуцію PnL. VIP+ отримує доступ до експериментальних індикаторів, режимів what-if/backtest і розширених горизонтів аналізу.`,

  `Економіка QCoin і L7-блокчейн. QCoin — паливо знань і корисного трафіку. Майбутній L7-chain — це шар, який поєднує кросмережеві активи, банки та фінінфраструктуру в універсальний маршрутизатор цінності. Наша мета — щоб QCoin став нейтральною розрахунковою одиницею в екосистемі, з прозорою емісією/спалюванням і чесною чергою виводу. VIP+ має підвищений пріоритет на розподіли й ранній доступ до стейкінгу/валідаторських ролей.`,

  `Оплата й активація. Підписка VIP+ оформлюється через NowPayments: криптооплата (USDT та ін.), вебхук миттєво активує доступ і синхронізує статус між MiniApp, ботом і форумом. Жодних скріншотів і ручних перевірок. Інтерфейс доступний 7 мовами; зв’язка гаманця — безшовна. Ви платите за швидкість, інтерпретованість і економіку, у якій внесок винагороджується.`,

  `Ком’юніті та дорожня карта. Ми публікуємо щотижневі нотатки, відкриваємо бети альфа-фіч, приймаємо цільові запити від команд. У беклозі: портфельний рушій із ризик-бюджетами, розширена смарт-маршрутизація CEX/DEX, публічні ноутбуки/бектести, «напівавтопілот» під контролем людини. Усе, що підвищує дисципліну й знижує тертя, іде в реліз; те, що блищить, але не допомагає — ні. Матеріали — освітні/аналітичні, не фінансова порада.`

El resultado no es una «caja negra», sino una tarjeta explicable: probabilidad del escenario, amplitud, horizontes, SL/TP, factores de confianza y enlaces a fuentes primarias.`,
      `La autorización es a través de carteras no custodiales: no almacenamos claves privadas, sino que confirmamos la titularidad de la dirección. Los derechos de acceso y las cuotas se sincronizan entre Telegram MiniApp, la interfaz web y el bot QL7, el estado VIP delimita los límites y da paso a canales de procesamiento prioritarios.`,
      `El núcleo de mercado se construye sobre agregación entre exchanges, unificación de símbolos/contratos y procesamiento de feeds con conciencia de latencia (latency-aware). Combinamos historiales de nivel institucional con flujos en tiempo real para seguir la dispersión del spread, volúmenes de impacto, balance de órdenes, riesgos MEV y el efecto del impulso de noticias.`,
      `El principio de la plataforma es la demostrabilidad: hipótesis → prueba → evidencias. Cada cálculo se registra, las métricas son reproducibles y el arbitraje del «ruido» se recorta con filtros de régimen. Así convertimos datos en bruto en decisiones disciplinadas, y la intuición en táctica verificable.`,
      `El foro se integra en el contorno: el contenido pasa por scoring de IA (calidad, engagement, anti-spam/anti-sybil), y la actividad se mapea a la economía de QCoin. No es una «red social por los likes», sino un bus cognitivo orientado a objetivos donde el conocimiento y la contribución se convierten en valor tokenizado.`,

about_title: 'Acerca de Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI no es solo «analítica», sino un único contorno operativo para la toma de decisiones de trading y la interacción social alrededor de los cripto­mercados. El núcleo de la plataforma unifica Web-MiniApp (web + Telegram), foros con minería gamificada de QCoin y un motor de investigación con IA que elimina el ruido, revela la estructura de liquidez y sugiere escenarios disciplinados de entrada/salida. Conectamos la microestructura del mercado, la telemetría on-chain, los patrones de comportamiento y las narrativas de noticias en una única capa coherente e interpretable, para que no tengas que «correr detrás» del mercado, sino poder diseñar la jugada de antemano.`,

  `Los agentes L7 son módulos de IA aplicados que viven de los datos. Leen documentos y feeds, consultan APIs, observan blockchains, libros de órdenes y derivados, ejecutan mini-experimentos y entregan artefactos explicables: hipótesis, instantáneas de backtest e indicadores contextuales. Lo importante no es la «magia de la caja negra», sino la trazabilidad: desde cada conclusión se ve el camino — qué señales se tuvieron en cuenta (liquidez, spreads, asimetría, desbalances, impulsos, clústeres de volumen), por qué se redujo el peso en zonas finas/manipulables y dónde está el límite de invalidez del escenario.`,

  `Para quién es. Para traders — conciencia situacional rápida y frecuencia de señales controlada sin sobrecarga; para investigadores — pipelines reproducibles y datos limpios; para equipos — API/SDK, webhooks y un bus de eventos confiable; para la comunidad de builders — foros, métricas de reputación y economía de QCoin por contribución. VIP+ obtiene un canal de IA prioritario, publicación de medios, cuotas aceleradas y un estatus «dorado» que influye en la exposición y los límites.`,

  `Cobertura. Agregamos datos de los principales CEX y agregadores DEX, normalizamos símbolos y metadatos de contratos, unificamos frecuencias de ticks y profundidad de libros. Introducimos catálogos unificados, mapeos de pares/redes/mercados, marcamos derivados, tenemos en cuenta splits, delistings y migraciones de contratos. El objetivo es la comparabilidad entre plataformas y redes: una sola capa de abstracción para comparar liquidez, costes, latencias y la disponibilidad «real» de volúmenes.`,

  `Pipeline de datos. Los flujos se limpian, los huecos se restauran, las anomalías se marcan y los contornos de latencia se calibran. La historia es profunda — esto permite identificar regímenes y no encajar un puntero sobre un pico aleatorio. Añadimos rutas on-chain, puentes de transferencia, distribuciones de holders, señales de actividad MEV y lo vinculamos con métricas de mercado. El resultado son conjuntos de características resistentes a «burbujas de ruido» y anomalías locales.`,

  `Núcleo analítico. Cientos de indicadores son solo la paleta. Lo principal son los conjuntos y el contexto: RSI/RSX, Stochastic, CCI/MFI, ADX/DI, ATR y bandas, EMA/SMA/WMA, MACD/Signal/Histogram, VWAP/POC/Value-Area, perfiles de volumen, desbalances Bid/Ask y barridos de liquidez. Mezclamos familias clásicas con filtros de régimen, heurísticas de liquidez y comportamiento, así como con un marcador on-chain de entrada/salida de flujos. Cada tarjeta no es un «consejo», sino una brújula: amplitud histórica, horizonte de materialización, confianza, supuestos y límites de invalidación.`,

  `Módulos on-chain. Rastrearmos clústeres de transferencias, puentes, acumulación/distribución, concentración de grandes tenedores, patrones MEV básicos y rutas anómalas. En zonas de liquidez fina, o con picos de funding o de spread, el peso de las señales se reduce; cuando se confirma en varios dominios (spot, derivados, on-chain) — aumenta. Así se minimiza la «falsa confianza» donde el mercado es frágil.`,

  `Narrativas y noticias. El feed multilingüe se traduce, se desduplica y se indexa mediante embeddings. Evaluamos la novedad, la confianza en la fuente, la proporción «ritual/esencia», la tonalidad y la persistencia del tema en el tiempo. Junto a las métricas de precio y on-chain aparece un «mapa de narrativa» ligero: qué impulsa la atención, dónde están los riesgos regulatorios, qué aumenta la volatilidad y qué se desinfla.`,

  `Tarjetas de señales y disciplina. En la tarjeta — amplitud esperada (cuantiles), horizonte temporal, marcadores SL/TP, un resumen rápido de liquidez y un conjunto de triggers que deben confluir. El sistema impulsa la disciplina: antes de entrar ves la invalidación, la unidad de riesgo y el corredor dinámico de volatilidad; después — recibes checkpoints de verificación y condiciones para retirar riesgo.`,

  `Arquitectura. Servicios ligeros en TypeScript/Python tras un API estable; el sitio — en Next.js con capas en vivo vía WebSocket. Niveles de caché y fuentes de respaldo aseguran una degradación suave en picos. API/SDK y webhooks habilitan la automatización, y los roles y el auditoría marcan límites seguros. MiniApp funciona en la web y en Telegram para que puedas llevar el mercado en un mismo flujo: gráficos, foro, billetera, bot — sin fricción.`,

  `Seguridad y privacidad. No custodial: no solicitamos ni almacenamos claves privadas/seed. Los roles restringen el acceso, las acciones se registran, los datos personales se minimizan y se cifran en tránsito y en reposo. Los pipelines anti-sybil/anti-fraude protegen la economía de QCoin y los mecanismos de reputación del foro; la validación de sesiones mantiene con cuidado, pero con rigor, la integridad del acceso.`,

  `Foro y minería de QCoin. El foro no es una «red social», sino una línea de producción de conocimiento. Cada 4 horas confirmas actividad y bloqueas la recompensa; las publicaciones con medios (video/imagen/audio) pasan el scoring de Quantum L7 AI (calidad, engagement, anti-spam/anti-sybil) y se convierten en QCoin. VIP+ obtiene X2 en tiempo y X2 en misiones, prioridad en la exposición, límites ampliados para medios y moderación acelerada. Reputación y contribución no son ruido vacío, sino una magnitud económicamente significativa.`,

  `Exchange (en desarrollo) y recomendaciones. El núcleo de trading y la ejecución se conectan por etapas; ya están disponibles recomendaciones con IA por símbolos/marcos temporales, profundidad de libro y perfil de liquidez. Diseñamos smart-routing, protección frente a latencias/deslizamiento, restricciones de cartera y atribución de PnL. VIP+ obtiene acceso a indicadores experimentales, modos what-if/backtest y horizontes de análisis ampliados.`,

  `Economía de QCoin y L7-blockchain. QCoin es el combustible del conocimiento y del tráfico útil. El futuro L7-chain es una capa que conecta activos cross-chain, bancos e infra financiera en un enrutador universal de valor. Nuestro objetivo es que QCoin se convierta en una unidad de liquidación neutral en el ecosistema, con emisión/quema transparente y una cola de retirada justa. VIP+ tiene prioridad elevada en distribuciones y acceso temprano a staking/roles de validador.`,

  `Pago y activación. La suscripción VIP+ se tramita vía NowPayments: pago cripto (USDT y otros), el webhook activa el acceso al instante y sincroniza el estatus entre MiniApp, bot y foro. Sin capturas de pantalla ni verificaciones manuales. La interfaz está disponible en 7 idiomas; el enlace con la billetera es sin fricción. Pagas por velocidad, interpretabilidad y una economía donde la contribución es recompensada.`,

  `Comunidad y hoja de ruta. Publicamos notas semanales, abrimos betas de funciones alfa y aceptamos solicitudes dirigidas de equipos. En el backlog: motor de carteras con presupuestos de riesgo, smart-routing ampliado CEX/DEX, notebooks/backtests públicos y «piloto semiautomático» bajo control humano. Todo lo que aumente la disciplina y reduzca la fricción va a release; lo que brilla pero no ayuda — no. Materiales — educativos/analíticos, no asesoramiento financiero.`

/* ===== ABOUT ===== */   
about_title: '关于 Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI 不仅仅是“分析”，而是围绕加密市场的交易决策与社会化互动的统一运营闭环。平台内核整合了 Web-MiniApp（网页 + Telegram）、带有游戏化 QCoin 挖矿的论坛，以及能降噪、识别流动性结构并给出纪律化入场/出场方案的 AI 研究引擎。我们把市场微观结构、链上遥测、行为模式与新闻叙事融合为一个一致且可解释的层，让你不必“追着”市场跑，而是可以提前设计下一步。`,

  `L7 代理是运行在数据之上的应用型 AI 模块。它们读取文档与信息流，请求 API，观察区块链、订单簿与衍生品，运行小型实验，并产出可解释的工件：假设、回测快照、上下文指标。重视的不是“黑箱魔法”，而是可追溯性：每个结论都能看到路径——考虑了哪些特征（流动性、价差、非对称、失衡、动量、成交量簇），为何在薄弱/易被操纵的区域降低权重，以及情景的失效边界在哪里。`,

  `适用对象。对交易员——快速的情境感知与可控的信号频率而不致过载；对研究者——可复现的流水线与干净数据；对团队——API/SDK、webhook 与可靠的事件总线；对构建者社区——论坛、声誉度量与按贡献计的 QCoin 经济。VIP+ 获得优先级 AI 通道、媒体发布、加速配额以及影响曝光与限额的“金色”状态。`,

  `覆盖面。我们聚合头部 CEX 与 DEX 聚合器的数据，规范化交易符号与合约元数据，统一 TICK 频率与订单簿深度。引入统一目录、交易对/网络/市场映射，标注衍生品，纳入拆分、下架与合约迁移。目标是平台与网络的可比性：用单一抽象层对比流动性、成本、延迟与“真实”的可用成交量。`,

  `数据流水线。数据流被清洗，缺口被修复，异常被标记，延迟轮廓被校准。历史足够深，从而识别“市场状态”，而不是把指针硬套在偶发尖峰上。我们加入链上路径、跨链桥、持有者分布、MEV 活动迹象，并把它们与市场指标相连。结果是对“噪声气泡”和局部异常足够稳健的特征集合。`,

  `分析内核。上百个指标只是调色板。关键在于“特征集合 + 上下文”：RSI/RSX、Stochastic、CCI/MFI、ADX/DI、ATR 与带宽、EMA/SMA/WMA、MACD/Signal/Histogram、VWAP/POC/Value-Area、成交量剖面、Bid/Ask 失衡与流动性扫单。我们把经典家族与状态过滤器、基于流动性与行为的启发式、以及链上流入/流出标记相融合。每张卡片不是“建议”，而是罗盘：历史幅度、实现期限、自信度、前提与失效边界。`,

  `链上模块。我们跟踪转账簇、跨链桥、累积/分配、大额持有者集中度、基础 MEV 模式与异常路径。在流动性薄弱区域或资金费率/价差飙升时，信号权重降低；当被多个域（现货、衍生品、链上）共同确认时，权重提升。这样能把市场脆弱处的“虚假自信”降到最低。`,

  `叙事与新闻。多语言信息流会被翻译、去重，并以嵌入向量索引。我们评估新颖性、来源可信度、“形式/实质”的比例、语调以及主题随时间的黏性。与价格与链上指标并排，会出现一张轻量的“叙事地图”：注意力被什么驱动、监管风险在哪里、哪些放大波动、哪些正在消退。`,

  `信号卡片与纪律。卡片上包含——期望幅度（分位数）、时间地平线、SL/TP 标记、流动性速览与必须共振的触发器集合。系统促使纪律：入场前你能看到失效点、风险单位与动态波动率走廊；入场后——会获得用于核对的检查点与减风险条件。`,

  `架构。以 TypeScript/Python 实现的轻量服务位于稳定 API 之后；站点基于 Next.js，并通过 WebSocket 提供实时层。缓存层与后备来源确保在峰值期间的平滑降级。API/SDK 与 webhook 支持自动化，而角色与审计定义安全边界。MiniApp 同时运行在 Web 与 Telegram 上，让你在单一流程中操盘市场：图表、论坛、钱包、机器人——无摩擦。`,

  `安全与隐私。非托管：我们不请求也不存储私钥/seed。通过角色限制访问、记录操作，个人数据最小化，并在传输与存储中加密。anti-sybil/anti-fraud 流水线保护 QCoin 经济与论坛的声誉机制；会话校验在温和且严格的前提下维护访问完整性。`,

  `论坛与 QCoin 挖矿。论坛不是“社交网络”，而是知识生产线。每 4 小时你确认活跃度并锁定奖励；含媒体（视频/图片/音频）的帖子通过 Quantum L7 AI 的评分（质量、参与度、反垃圾/反女巫）并转化为 QCoin。VIP+ 获得时间 X2 与任务 X2、曝光优先、扩展的媒体限额与加速审核。声誉与贡献不是空噪声，而是具有经济意义的量。`,

  `交易所（开发中）与推荐。交易内核与执行会分阶段接入；已提供按品种/周期的 AI 推荐、订单簿深度与流动性画像。我们设计智能路由、延迟/滑点防护、组合约束与 PnL 归因。VIP+ 可访问实验性指标、what-if/回测模式与更宽的分析视野。`,

  `QCoin 经济与 L7 区块链。QCoin 是知识与有效流量的燃料。未来的 L7-chain 是把跨网络资产、银行与金融基础设施连接起来的通用价值路由层。我们的目标是让 QCoin 成为生态内的中性结算单位，具备透明的发行/销毁与公平的提现队列。VIP+ 在分配上享有更高优先级，并可更早获得质押/验证者角色的通道。`,

  `支付与激活。VIP+ 订阅通过 NowPayments 办理：加密支付（USDT 等），Webhook 即刻激活访问并在 MiniApp、机器人与论坛之间同步状态。无需截图与人工核验。界面支持 7 种语言；钱包绑定无缝。你为速度、可解释性，以及一个对贡献予以回报的经济付费。`,

  `社区与路线图。我们发布每周笔记、开放 alpha 功能的 beta 测试，并接受团队的定向需求。待办中：带风险预算的组合引擎、增强的 CEX/DEX 智能路由、公开笔记本/回测、“半自动驾驶”（人控）。凡能提升纪律、降低摩擦的都会发布；那些华而不实的则不会。所有材料均为教育/分析内容，非财务建议。`

      `عملاء L7 يقرؤون المستندات وواجهات API بشكل مستقل، ويراقبون سلاسل الكتل ودفاتر الأوامر، ويصنفون الأنماط السلوكية، ويقيّمون أوضاع السوق ويستنتجون فرضيات قابلة للتحقق. النتيجة ليست "صندوقًا أسود"، بل بطاقة قابلة للتفسير: احتمال السيناريو، السعة، الآفاق، SL/TP، عوامل الثقة وروابط إلى المصادر الأصلية.`,
      `تسجيل الدخول عبر محافظ غير وصائية: لا نخزن المفاتيح الخاصة بل نتحقق من ملكية العنوان. يتم مزامنة حقوق الوصول والحصص بين Telegram MiniApp وواجهة الويب وروبوت QL7، حالة VIP تحدد حدود القيود وتمنح أولوية في قنوات المعالجة.`,
      `نواة السوق مبنية على تراكم عبر البورصات، وتوحيد الرموز/العقود، ومعالجة خلاصات مدركة للكمون. ندمج البيانات المؤسسية التاريخية مع التدفقات الآنية لتتبع تشتت الفروق، الأحجام الصادمة، توازن الطلبات، مخاطر MEV وتأثير نبض الأخبار.`,
      `مبدأ المنصة هو الإثبات: فرضية → اختبار → أدلة. كل عملية حسابية يتم تسجيلها، المقاييس قابلة لإعادة الإنتاج، ويتم استبعاد "ضوضاء" المراجحة عبر مرشحات الأوضاع. وهكذا نحول البيانات الخام إلى قرارات منضبطة، والحدس إلى تكتيك قابل للتحقق.`,
      `المنتدى جزء من الحلقة: المحتوى يخضع لتقييم ذكاء اصطناعي (جودة، تفاعل، مكافحة البريد المزعج/anti-sybil)، والنشاط يُرسم على اقتصاد QCoin. إنها ليست "شبكة اجتماعية من أجل الإعجابات"، بل حافلة معرفية موجهة حيث تتحول المعرفة والمساهمة إلى قيمة رمزية.`,

about_title: 'حول Quantum L7 AI',
about_paragraphs: [
  `Quantum L7 AI ليس مجرد «تحليلات»، بل هو مسارٌ تشغيلي موحّد لاتخاذ قرارات التداول والتفاعل الاجتماعي حول أسواق التشفير. نواة المنصّة توحّد Web-MiniApp (الويب + تيليغرام)، والمنتديات مع تعدين QCoin المُعمّم بنظام اللعب، ومحرك بحثٍ بحثيّ بالذكاء الاصطناعي يخفّض الضوضاء، ويكشف بنية السيولة، ويقترح سيناريوهات دخول/خروج منضبطة. نحن نصل البنيةَ الميكروية للسوق، والقياس عن بُعد على السلسلة، والأنماط السلوكية، والسرديات الإخبارية في طبقة واحدة منسجمة قابلة للتفسير — حتى لا تضطر «لمطاردة» السوق، بل لتصميم الخطوة مسبقًا.`,

  `وكلاء L7 هي وحدات ذكاء اصطناعي تطبيقية تعيش على البيانات. تقرأ الوثائق والتغذيات، تطلب واجهات API، تراقب البلوكشينات ودفاتر الأوامر والمشتقات، تُشغِّل تجارب مصغّرة وتُخرج مُخرجات قابلة للتفسير: فروض، لقطات backtest، ومؤشرات سياقية. المهم ليس «سحر الصندوق الأسود»، بل القابلية للتتبّع: من كل استنتاج يظهر المسار — ما السمات التي أُخذت بالحسبان (السيولة، الفروقات، اللاتماثل، الاختلالات، الزخم، عناقيد الأحجام)، ولماذا خُفِّض الوزن في المناطق الرقيقة/القابلة للتلاعب، وأين تمرّ حدود بطلان السيناريو.`,

  `لمن هذا. للمتداولين — وعيٌ سياقي سريع وتردد إشارات مُتحكَّم به دون إرهاق؛ وللباحثين — خطوط معالجة قابلة لإعادة الإنتاج وبيانات نظيفة؛ وللفِرَق — API/SDK و webhooks وحافّة أحداث موثوقة؛ ولمجتمع البنّائين — منتديات ومقاييس سمعة واقتصاد QCoin مقابل المساهمة. يحصل VIP+ على قناة ذكاء اصطناعي ذات أولوية، ونشر وسائط، وحصص مُعجّلة، وحالة «ذهبية» تؤثر على الظهور والحدود.`,

  `التغطية. نُجمّع البيانات من أبرز منصّات CEX ومجمّعات DEX، نطبع الرموز وبيانات تعريف العقود، نوحّد ترددات التيك وعمق دفاتر الأوامر. ندخل دلائل موحّدة، وخرائط أزواج/شبكات/أسواق، نُعلِّم المشتقات، ونأخذ بالانقسامات وشطب الإدراج وهجرة العقود. الهدف — قابلية مقارنة المنصات والشبكات: طبقة تجريد واحدة لمقارنة السيولة والتكاليف والتأخّر و«التوافر الحقيقي» للأحجام.`,

  `خط أنابيب البيانات. تُنقّى التدفقات، تُرمّم الفجوات، تُعلَّم الشذوذات، وتُعايَر محيطات التأخّر. التاريخ عميق — ما يتيح كشف الأنظمة بدلاً من شدّ المؤشر على ومضة عشوائية. نضيف المسارات على السلسلة، الجسور التحويلية، توزيعات الحائزين، دلائل نشاط MEV ونربط ذلك بمقاييس السوق. النتيجة — مجموعات سمات متينة ضد «فقاعات الضوضاء» والشذوذات المحلية.`,

  `النواة التحليلية. مئات المؤشرات ليست سوى لوحة ألوان. الأساس — المجموعات والسياق: RSI/RSX و Stochastic و CCI/MFI و ADX/DI و ATR والشرائط، و EMA/SMA/WMA و MACD/Signal/Histogram و VWAP/POC/Value-Area، وبروفايلات الحجم، واختلالات Bid/Ask و«كنس» السيولة. نمزج العائلات الكلاسيكية مع مرشّحات الأنماط، والحدسيات المبنية على السيولة والسلوك، ومع مُؤشِّر التدفق/الخروج على السلسلة. كل بطاقة ليست «نصيحة»، بل بوصلة: السعة تاريخيًا، أفق التحقّق، الثقة، الفرضيات، وحدود الإبطال.`,

  `وحدات على السلسلة. نتابع عناقيد التحويل، والجسور، والتراكم/التوزيع، وتركيز الحائزين الكبار، وأنماط MEV الأساسية والمسارات الشاذة. في مناطق السيولة الرقيقة أو عند طفرة الفاندنغ أو الفروقات، يُخفض وزن الإشارات؛ وعند التأكيد عبر مجالات متعددة (سبوت، مشتقات، على السلسلة) يُرفع. هكذا نقلّل «الثقة الزائفة» في مواضع هشاشة السوق.`,

  `السرديات والأخبار. تُترجم التغذية متعددة اللغات، وتُزال المكررات، وتُفهرس بالتضمينات. نقيس الجِدّة، وثوقية المصدر، نسبة «الطقس/الجوهر»، النبرة، و«لزوجة» الموضوع عبر الزمن. بجوار مقاييس السعر وما على السلسلة، تظهر «خريطة سردية» خفيفة: ما الذي يقود الانتباه، أين مخاطر التنظيم، ما الذي يضخّم التذبذب، وما الذي يخبو.`,

  `بطاقات الإشارات والانضباط. على البطاقة — السعة المتوقعة (الكوَنتيلات)، الأفق الزمني، علامات SL/TP، ملخص سريع للسيولة ومجموعة مُشغّلات يجب أن تتلاقى. المنظومة تدفع نحو الانضباط: قبل الدخول ترى الإبطال، وحدة المخاطرة، وممر تذبذب ديناميكي؛ وبعده — تتلقى نقاط فحص وشروط خفض المخاطرة.`,

  `البنية. خدمات خفيفة بـ TypeScript/Python خلف API مستقر؛ الموقع على Next.js بطبقات حيّة عبر WebSocket. طبقات الكاش والمصادر الاحتياطية تضمن هبوطًا سلسًا وقت الذروة. API/SDK و webhooks يتيحان الأتمتة، بينما الأدوار والتدقيق يرسمان حدود الأمان. MiniApp يعمل على الويب وفي تيليغرام، لتقود السوق في مسار واحد: رسوم بيانية، منتدى، محفظة، بوت — بلا احتكاك.`,

  `الأمان والخصوصية. غير وصائي: لا نطلب ولا نخزّن المفاتيح الخاصة/seed. تُقيَّد الصلاحيات عبر الأدوار، وتُسجَّل الأفعال، وتُقلّل البيانات الشخصية وتُشفّر في النقل والتخزين. خطوط anti-sybil/anti-fraud تحمي اقتصاد QCoin وآليات السمعة في المنتدى؛ والتحقّق من الجلسات يحافظ بعناية — ولكن بصرامة — على سلامة الوصول.`,

  `المنتدى وتعدين QCoin. المنتدى ليس «شبكة اجتماعية»، بل خط إنتاج للمعرفة. كل 4 ساعات تؤكّد النشاط وتُقفل المكافأة؛ المنشورات ذات الوسائط (فيديو/صور/صوت) تمر بتقييم Quantum L7 AI (جودة، تفاعل، مضاد للسبام/للسيبيل) وتتحوّل إلى QCoin. يحصل VIP+ على ×2 في الوقت و×2 في المهام، أولوية في الظهور، حدود موسّعة للوسائط وتدقيقًا مُسرَّعًا. السمعة والمساهمة ليست ضجيجًا فارغًا، بل مقدار ذو دلالة اقتصادية.`,

  `البورصة (قيد التطوير) والتوصيات. نواة التداول والتنفيذ تُربطان تدريجيًا؛ تتوفر بالفعل توصيات ذكاء اصطناعي بحسب الرموز/الأُطر الزمنية، وعمق دفتر الأوامر وبروفايل السيولة. نُصمّم توجيهًا ذكيًا، وحماية من التأخّر/الانزلاق، وقيود محفظية، ونَسب PnL. يحصل VIP+ على مؤشرات تجريبية، وأنماط what-if/backtest، وآفاق تحليل موسّعة.`,

  `اقتصاد QCoin وسلسلة L7. الـ QCoin هو وقود المعرفة والحركة المفيدة. سلسلة L7 المستقبلية طبقة تصل الأصول عَبْر الشبكات والبنوك والبنية المالية إلى مُوجِّه قيمة عام. هدفنا أن يصبح QCoin وحدة تسوية محايدة في المنظومة، بإصدار/حرق شفاف وطابور سحب عادل. يتمتع VIP+ بأولوية أعلى في التوزيعات وبوصول مبكر لأدوار التخزين/التحقق.`,

  `الدفع والتفعيل. اشتراك VIP+ يتم عبر NowPayments: دفعٌ بالعملات المشفّرة (USDT وغيرها)، يُفعِّل الـ webhook الوصول فورًا ويُزامن الحالة بين MiniApp والبوت والمنتدى. لا لقطات شاشة ولا فحوصات يدوية. الواجهة متاحة بـ 7 لغات؛ ربط المحفظة سلس. أنت تدفع مقابل السرعة والقابلية للتفسير واقتصادٍ تُكافَأ فيه المساهمة.`,

  `المجتمع وخارطة الطريق. ننشر مذكرات أسبوعية، نفتح بيتا لميزات ألفا، ونتلقّى طلبات موجّهة من الفرق. في قائمة العمل: محرّك محفظة بميزانيات مخاطر، توجيه ذكي موسّع CEX/DEX، دفاتر/اختبارات عامة، و«طيار نصف آلي» تحت تحكّم بشري. كل ما يعزّز الانضباط ويقلّل الاحتكاك يذهب للإصدار؛ وما يلمع ولا يُفيد — فلا. المواد تعليمية/تحليلية، وليست نصيحةً مالية.`

  `Quantum L7 Exchange — هي منصة تداول متعددة السلاسل، قابلة للتفسير بشكل موثوق من الجيل الجديد،
توحِّد سيولة CEX/DEX، وتوصيات الذكاء الاصطناعي، والبنية التحتية المؤسسية للبيانات في نسيج حوسبي موحّد.
نعالج 87 تيرابايت من تواريخ السوق وأكثر من 37 مليار شمعة تاريخية عبر جميع الشبكات والمنصات الكبرى، ونقوم بتطبيع التكات،
وعمق دفاتر الأوامر ومواصفات المشتقات، لنجعل السوق وفق معيار واحد لاتخاذ القرار. الهدف ليس «بورصة أخرى»،
بل حلقة تنفيذ بمنطق قابل للإثبات: فرضية → اختبار → أدلة → صفقة، مع محددات مخاطر شفافة وتدقيق قابل للتتبع.`,

  `Quantum L7 AI sadece bir “analitik” değildir; kripto piyasaları etrafında ticaret kararları almayı ve sosyal etkileşimi birleştiren tek bir operasyonel sistemdir. Platformun çekirdeği, Web-MiniApp’i (web + Telegram), oyunlaştırılmış QCoin madenciliğine sahip forumları ve gürültüyü azaltan, likidite yapısını ortaya çıkaran ve disiplinli giriş/çıkış senaryoları öneren bir yapay zekâ araştırma motorunu bir araya getirir. Piyasa mikro yapısını, zincir üstü telemetrileri, davranış kalıplarını ve haber anlatılarını tek bir uyumlu ve yorumlanabilir katmanda birleştiriyoruz — böylece piyasayı “yakalamak” zorunda kalmaz, adımı önceden planlayabilirsiniz.`,

  `L7 ajanları — veriler üzerinde yaşayan uygulamalı yapay zekâ modülleridir. Belgeleri ve akışları okur, API’lere istek gönderir, blok zincirlerini, emir defterlerini ve türevleri gözlemler, mini deneyler yürütür ve açıklanabilir çıktılar sunar: hipotezler, backtest anlık görüntüleri, bağlamsal göstergeler. Burada önemli olan “kara kutu büyüsü” değil, izlenebilirliktir: Her sonuçta yol görünür — hangi özellikler dikkate alınmıştır (likidite, spread’ler, asimetri, dengesizlikler, momentum, hacim kümeleri), neden ince/manipüle edilebilir alanlarda ağırlık azaltılmıştır ve senaryonun geçersizlik sınırı nerededir.`,

  `Kimin için. Tüccarlar için — hızlı durumsal farkındalık ve aşırı yüklenmeden kontrol edilebilir sinyal sıklığı; araştırmacılar için — yeniden üretilebilir veri işleme hatları ve temiz veri; ekipler için — API/SDK, webhook’lar ve güvenilir bir olay hattı; geliştirici topluluğu için — forumlar, itibar metrikleri ve katkıya dayalı QCoin ekonomisi. VIP+ kullanıcıları, öncelikli bir yapay zekâ kanalı, medya paylaşımı, hızlandırılmış kotalar ve görünürlük ve limitleri etkileyen “altın” statü elde eder.`,

  `Kapsam. Önde gelen CEX ve DEX toplayıcılarından veri topluyor, sembolleri ve sözleşme meta verilerini normalleştiriyor, tik frekanslarını ve emir defteri derinliklerini birleştiriyoruz. Birleşik dizinler, çiftler/ağlar/piyasalar için eşleştirmeler oluşturuyor, türevleri işaretliyor, bölünmeleri, delistleri ve sözleşme göçlerini hesaba katıyoruz. Amaç — platformlar ve ağlar arasında karşılaştırılabilirliktir: likiditeyi, maliyetleri, gecikmeleri ve “gerçek” hacim kullanılabilirliğini karşılaştırmak için tek bir soyutlama katmanı.`,

  `Veri hattı. Akışlar temizlenir, eksikler onarılır, anormallikler işaretlenir, gecikme konturları kalibre edilir. Derin geçmiş, rastgele bir sıçrama yerine rejimleri tanımlama olanağı sağlar. Zincir üstü yollar, köprüler, sahip dağılımları, MEV etkinliği göstergeleri ekliyor ve bunları piyasa metrikleriyle ilişkilendiriyoruz. Sonuç — “gürültü kabarcıklarına” ve yerel anormalliklere dayanıklı özellik kümeleri.`,

  `Analitik çekirdek. Yüzlerce gösterge yalnızca bir palettir. Önemli olan — ansambller ve bağlamdır: RSI/RSX, Stochastic, CCI/MFI, ADX/DI, ATR ve bantlar, EMA/SMA/WMA, MACD/Signal/Histogram, VWAP/POC/Value-Area, hacim profilleri, Bid/Ask dengesizlikleri ve likidite süpürmeleri. Klasik aileleri rejim filtreleriyle, likidite ve davranışa dayalı sezgilerle ve zincir üstü giriş/çıkış işaretçileriyle birleştiriyoruz. Her kart bir “tavsiye” değil, bir pusuladır: tarihsel genlik, gerçekleştirme ufku, güven düzeyi, varsayımlar ve geçersizlik sınırları.`,

  `Zincir üstü modüller. Transfer kümelerini, köprüleri, birikim/dağılımı, büyük sahip yoğunluklarını, temel MEV kalıplarını ve anormal yolları izliyoruz. İnce likidite bölgelerinde veya fonlama/spread patlamalarında sinyal ağırlığı azalır; birden fazla alan (spot, türev, zincir üstü) tarafından onaylandığında artar. Bu, piyasanın kırılgan olduğu yerlerde “yanlış güven”i en aza indirir.`,

  `Anlatılar ve haberler. Çok dilli akış çevrilir, yinelenenler kaldırılır ve gömülerle endekslenir. Yenilik, kaynak güvenilirliği, “ritüel/öz” oranı, ton ve konunun zaman içindeki “yoğunluğu” değerlendirilir. Fiyat ve zincir üstü metriklerin yanında hafif bir “anlatı haritası” görünür: ilgiyi ne yönlendiriyor, düzenleyici riskler nerede, volatiliteyi ne artırıyor, ne sönümleniyor.`,

  `Sinyal kartları ve disiplin. Kartta — beklenen genlik (kantiller), zaman ufku, SL/TP işaretleri, hızlı likidite özeti ve bir araya gelmesi gereken tetikleyici seti bulunur. Sistem disiplini teşvik eder: Giriş öncesinde geçersizliği, risk birimini ve dinamik volatilite koridorunu görürsünüz; sonrasında — kontrol noktaları ve risk azaltma koşulları alırsınız.`,

  `Mimari. TypeScript/Python üzerinde hafif servisler, istikrarlı bir API’nin arkasında; site — WebSocket üzerinden canlı katmanlarla Next.js üzerine kuruludur. Önbellek seviyeleri ve yedek kaynaklar, zirve zamanlarında sorunsuz bozulmayı sağlar. API/SDK ve webhook’lar otomasyon sağlar, roller ve denetimler güvenli sınırlar belirler. MiniApp, web’de ve Telegram’da çalışır, böylece piyasayı tek bir akışta yönetebilirsiniz: grafikler, forum, cüzdan, bot — sürtünmesiz.`,

  `Güvenlik ve gizlilik. Saklama yapılmaz: özel anahtarlar/seed istenmez veya saklanmaz. Roller erişimi sınırlar, eylemler kaydedilir, kişisel veriler en aza indirilir ve iletim/depolama sırasında şifrelenir. Anti-sybil/anti-fraud hatları QCoin ekonomisini ve forumun itibar mekanizmalarını korur; oturum doğrulaması dikkatli ama sıkı bir şekilde erişim bütünlüğünü sürdürür.`,

  `Forum ve QCoin madenciliği. Forum bir “sosyal ağ” değil, bilgi üretim hattıdır. Her 4 saatte bir etkinliği onaylar ve ödülü kilitlersiniz; medya içeren gönderiler (video/görsel/ses) Quantum L7 AI tarafından (kalite, etkileşim, anti-spam/anti-sybil) puanlanır ve QCoin’e dönüştürülür. VIP+ zaman açısından ×2 ve görevlerde ×2 alır, listelerde öncelik, genişletilmiş medya limitleri ve hızlandırılmış moderasyon elde eder. İtibar ve katkı, boş bir gürültü değil, ekonomik olarak anlamlı bir değerdir.`,

  `Borsa (geliştirme aşamasında) ve öneriler. Ticaret çekirdeği ve yürütme kademeli olarak bağlanır; şu anda sembol/zaman aralıkları, emir defteri derinliği ve likidite profiline göre yapay zekâ önerileri mevcuttur. Akıllı yönlendirme, gecikme/kayma koruması, portföy kısıtlamaları ve PnL atfı tasarlıyoruz. VIP+ deneysel göstergelere, what-if/backtest modlarına ve genişletilmiş analiz ufuklarına erişim sağlar.`,

  `QCoin ekonomisi ve L7 blok zinciri. QCoin — bilgi ve faydalı trafiğin yakıtıdır. Gelecekteki L7-chain, çapraz ağ varlıklarını, bankaları ve finansal altyapıyı evrensel bir değer yönlendiriciye bağlayan bir katmandır. Amacımız, QCoin’in ekosistem içinde şeffaf ihraç/yakım ve adil çekim sırası ile nötr bir hesap birimi haline gelmesidir. VIP+, dağıtımlarda artırılmış önceliğe ve stake/doğrulayıcı rollere erken erişime sahiptir.`,

  `Ödeme ve aktivasyon. VIP+ aboneliği NowPayments üzerinden yapılır: kripto ödeme (USDT vb.), webhook erişimi anında etkinleştirir ve durumu MiniApp, bot ve forum arasında senkronize eder. Ekran görüntüleri veya manuel doğrulamalar gerekmez. Arayüz 7 dilde mevcuttur; cüzdan bağlantısı sorunsuzdur. Hız, yorumlanabilirlik ve katkının ödüllendirildiği bir ekonomi için ödeme yaparsınız.`,

  `Topluluk ve yol haritası. Haftalık notlar yayımlıyoruz, alfa özelliklerinin betalarını açıyoruz, ekiplerden hedefli talepler alıyoruz. Geri planda: risk bütçeleriyle portföy motoru, gelişmiş CEX/DEX akıllı yönlendirme, herkese açık not defterleri/backtest’ler, insan kontrolünde “yarı otomatik pilot”. Disiplini artıran ve sürtünmeyi azaltan her şey yayına girer; parlayan ama faydasız olanlar — asla. Materyaller — eğitimsel/analitik, finansal tavsiye değildir.`

    'Quantum L7 is not "just another service" but a unified decision-making framework. 87 TB of market data, 37 billion historical candles across-chains, cross-exchange aggregation, liquidity normalization, and latency-aware processing. One account opens the Web MiniApp, Telegram bot QL7 AI Bot, and the Forum with QCoin mining. The MiniApp runs in Telegram and on the web; exchange recommendations are already delivered in real time (trading core and execution are in the final stage). VIP+ provides unlimited AI analytics time, X2 quest multipliers, and bonus QCoin accruals for media content (video/images/audio) that passes scoring by the Quantum L7 AI engine. Payment is via NowPayments: once on-chain confirmation arrives, access is activated instantly and synchronized across MiniApp/bot/forum. Ahead — the launch of the next-generation L7 blockchain: VIPs receive a higher priority tier for distribution and QCoin withdrawal queue, early access to staking/validator roles, and increased limits. Seven interface languages, precise wallet integration, strict risk management discipline, and “entry windows” without noise — everything to keep you in the market flow.',

VIP+ дає безліміт часу ІІ-аналітики, X2 квест-множники та бонусні QCoin-нарахування за медіаконтент (відео/зображення/аудіо), який проходить скоринг рушієм Quantum L7 AI. Оплата — через NowPayments: щойно on-chain підтвердження надійшло, доступ вмикається миттєво та синхронізується в MiniApp/боті/форумі. Попереду — запуск L7-блокчейну нового покоління: VIP отримують підвищений priority tier на розподіл і чергу виведення QCoin, ранній доступ до стейкінгу/валідаторських ролей і підвищені ліміти. Сім мов інтерфейсу, акуратна зв’язка гаманця, сувора дисципліна ризик-менеджменту та «вікна входу» без шуму — усе, щоб тримати тебе в ринковому потоці.',

ai_note_funding_v2: "Потому что аномальный funding намекает на дисбаланс между long и short, и Brain воспринимает это как фактор риска против переполненной стороны.",
ai_note_funding_v3: "Потому что через funding Brain видит, кто переплачивает за плечо, и это усиливает вероятность движения против перегруженных позиций.",
ai_note_funding_v4: "Потому что высокий по модулю funding — предупреждение о неустойчивом балансе на фьючерсах, и Brain снижает уверенность в продолжении текущей внебалансовой стороны.",
ai_note_funding_v5: "Потому что Brain использует funding как термометр жадности/страха на деривативах, что помогает не вставать в очередь с толпой.",

ai_note_oi_change: "Потому что изменение Open Interest {oiChange} показывает приток/отток денег в фьючерсы, и так Brain отличает «живое» движение от пустой волатильности.",
ai_note_oi_change_v2: "Потому что рост OI при движении цены усиливает тренд-сигнал, а падение OI его ослабляет — именно так Brain читает метрику {oiChange}.",
ai_note_oi_change_v3: "Потому что через динамику Open Interest Brain понимает, открываются ли новые позиции или рынок лишь выносит старые.",
ai_note_oi_change_v4: "Потому что сильные сдвиги OI — знак перераспределения риска между участниками, и Brain использует это для уточнения сигнала.",
ai_note_oi_change_v5: "Потому что Brain смотрит на {oiChange}, чтобы не путать истинный тренд с движением на закрытии позиций.",

ai_note_basis: "Потому что фьючерсный basis={basis} отражает разницу между futures и spot, и сильное отклонение говорит о перегреве одной из сторон, что Brain учитывает в рисках.",
ai_note_basis_v2: "Потому что атипичный basis сигнализирует о перекосе ожиданий на деривативах, и Brain не игнорирует этот скрытый стресс-маркер.",
ai_note_basis_v3: "Потому что basis показывает, насколько рынок готов переплачивать или дисконтировать будущую цену; при крайних значениях Brain осторожнее.",
ai_note_basis_v4: "Потому что сильный basis в сторону быков или медведей часто предшествует разворотам, и Brain учитывает это, чтобы не залезать в хвост тренда.",
ai_note_basis_v5: "Потому что Brain использует basis как индикатор доверия к тренду на фьючерсах, особенно когда он выходит за нормальные уровни.",

ai_note_dominance: "Потому что dominance Bitcoin около {dominance}% показывает баланс силы между BTC и альтами; при высокой dominance Brain закладывает давление на альткоины.",
ai_note_dominance_v2: "Потому что рост BTC-dominance обычно ухудшает условия для альтов, и Brain учитывает это как внешний медвежий фон для них.",
ai_note_dominance_v3: "Потому что низкая dominance BTC, наоборот, открывает окно возможностей для альтов, и Brain корректирует риск-профиль под такую фазу.",
ai_note_dominance_v4: "Потому что через метрику dominance Brain видит, куда стекает ликвидность — в «синий чип» BTC или в более рискованные активы.",
ai_note_dominance_v5: "Потому что изменения dominance помогают Brain понять, кто сейчас в фаворе у рынка — Bitcoin или альты, и подстроить сигналы под этот сдвиг.",

ai_note_btc_corr_v2: "Потому что высокая корреляция с BTC означает, что судьба актива во многом зависит от движения Bitcoin, и Brain учитывает это при формировании портфеля.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v3: "Потому что низкая корреляция с BTC делает актив более самостоятельным, и Brain использует это для диверсификации рисков.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v4: "Потому что через корреляцию с BTC Brain оценивает, насколько сигнал по этому активу уникален, а не копия BTC-позы.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v5: "Потому что сдвиги в {corr} помогают Brain понять, усиливается ли связка с BTC или ослабевает, и скорректировать ожидания по движению.",

ai_note_global_spot: "Потому что состояние глобального spot-рынка оценивается как {globalSpot}, и Brain использует этот фон как фильтр, усиливая или смягчая локальные сигналы.",

ai_note_global_spot_v3: "Потому что если global spot слабый, Brain осторожнее с агрессивными лонгами, даже при хорошей локальной картине.",
ai_note_global_spot_v4: "Потому что сильный spot-фон делает бычьи сигналы более надёжными, и Brain учитывает этот tailwind.",
ai_note_global_spot_v5: "Потому что Brain всегда сверяет локальный сигнал с global spot-картиной ({globalSpot}), чтобы не торговать против общего потока ликвидности.",

ai_note_venue_spread: "Потому что повышенный venue spread={spread} говорит о неоднородности цен и возможных проскальзываниях, и Brain рекомендует более консервативный размер позиции.",

ai_note_venue_spread_v4: "Потому что расширенный venue spread подсказывает Brain, что сейчас не лучший момент для крупных ордеров.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v5: "Потому что Brain воспринимает высокий spread между биржами как сигнал затормозить и торговать аккуратнее, чтобы избежать лишних потерь на исполнении.",

ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_on: "Тому що короткострокова EMA21 вище MA50 і MA200, ринок структурно на боці покупців, і Brain підсилює вагу бичачого сценарію по цьому активу.",
ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_on_v2: "Тому що EMA21 пробита й утримується вище MA50/MA200, що показує стійкий up-trend, і Brain упевненіше підтримує лонгову ідею.",
ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_on_v3: "Тому що домінування EMA21 над MA50 і MA200 говорить про свіжий сильний імпульс угору, і Brain враховує це як аргумент за продовження зростання.",
ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_on_v4: "Тому що позиція EMA21 вище MA50 і MA200 — класична ознака бичачої структури, і Brain робить акцент на long-сценаріях, поки ця зв’язка не зламана.",
ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_on_v5: "Тому що EMA21 > MA50 > MA200, тренд підтверджений на кількох горизонтах, і Brain допускає більш сміливі лонгові рішення в рамках risk-менеджменту.",

ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_off_v4: "Тому що поки EMA21 торгується нижче середньострокових MA, ринок виглядає більш нейтрально або ведмежо, і Brain зміщує фокус від агресивних покупок.",
ai_f_ema21_gt_ma50_off_v5: "Тому що зламана каскадна структура EMA21>MA50>MA200, домінування биків під питанням, і Brain враховує це як аргумент проти високих лонгових ризиків.",

ai_f_ma50_gt_ma200_on: "Тому що MA50 вище MA200, сформовано середньостроковий бичачий тренд, і Brain дає більше ваги лонгам та утриманню позицій у напрямку тренду.",

ai_f_ma50_gt_ma200_off: "Тому що MA50 нижче MA200, базовий контекст залишається ведмежим або слабким, і Brain обережніше ставиться до лонгів і жорсткіше контролює ризик.",
ai_f_ma50_gt_ma200_off_v2: "Тому що перехрестя MA50 під MA200 показує, що глобальна структура ринку не на користь покупців, і Brain не розглядає це як комфортний фон для довгих позицій.",
ai_f_ma50_gt_ma200_off_v3: "Тому що коли MA50 падає нижче MA200, це сигнал про погіршення середньострокового тренду, і Brain відповідно знижує пріоритет бичачих ідей.",
ai_f_ma50_gt_ma200_off_v4: "Тому що структура MA50<MA200 вказує на підвищений ризик затяжного даун-тренду, і Brain не заохочує агресивні покупки в такому оточенні.",

ai_f_price_gt_vwap_off_v3: "Тому що ціна під VWAP — індикатор локальної слабкості, і Brain знижує пріоритет long-сценаріїв та враховує ризик подальшого тиску вниз.",
ai_f_price_gt_vwap_off_v4: "Тому що коли ціна закріплюється нижче VWAP, контроль переходить до продавців, і Brain рекомендує більш захисний підхід до покупок.",
ai_f_price_gt_vwap_off_v5: "Тому що позиція нижче VWAP означає, що середній учасник ринку продає актив дешевше, і Brain враховує це як несприятливий фон для нових лонгів.",

ai_f_adx_flat_v5: "Тому що коли ADX низький, Brain вважає ринок шумним і не схильний давати агресивні directional-сигнали.",

// ===== OBV =====
ai_f_obv: "Тому що нахил OBV близько {slope} показує, як іде приплив або відтік обсягу, і Brain використовує це, щоб підтвердити або спростувати чисто ціновий рух.",

// ===== ATR / волатильность =====
ai_note_atr: "Тому що ATR={atr} (atrRel={atrRel}, ≈{atrPct}% від ціни) задає типовий денний діапазон, і Brain на цій волатильності оцінює очікуваний хід 1h≈{h1}, 6h≈{h6}, 24h≈{h24} і будує рівні стопів/тейків.",
ai_note_atr_v2: "Тому що середній істинний діапазон ATR {atr} (близько {atrPct}% від ціни) допомагає Brain зрозуміти, наскільки далеко ціна зазвичай ходить і які стопи/цілі виглядають реалістичними.",
ai_note_atr_v3: "Тому що через ATR Brain калібрує масштаб руху: atrRel={atrRel}, atrPct≈{atrPct}%, і це задає розумні очікування щодо ризику та профіту.",
ai_note_atr_v4: "Тому що параметр ATR відображає «дихання» ринку; при {atrPct}% від ціни Brain обирає такі стопи й цілі, щоб не бути вибитим шумом.",
ai_note_atr_v5: "Тому що Brain спирається на ATR {atr} і його частку від ціни ({atrPct}%), щоб балансувати ризик/дохідність і не завищувати очікування по ходу.",

ai_f_vola_explosive: "Тому що atrRel={atrRel} (≈{atrPct}% від ціни) показує вибухову волатильність, і Brain рекомендує зменшувати розмір позиції та розширювати захисні стопи.",
ai_f_vola_explosive_v2: "Тому що при такій волатильності ({atrPct}% від ціни) будь-який бар може бути аномально великим, і Brain трактує це як високий ризик, радячи акуратний risk-менеджмент.",
ai_f_vola_explosive_v3: "Тому що вибухова vola збільшує і потенціал, і просадку, і Brain не пропонує перевантажувати депо при atrRel={atrRel}.",
ai_f_vola_explosive_v4: "Тому що коли волатильність виходить на екстремальні рівні, ринок стає менш передбачуваним, і Brain рекомендує діяти консервативно.",
ai_f_vola_explosive_v5: "Тому що суперволатильний режим (atrPct≈{atrPct}%) — зона, де важливіше вижити, ніж зловити кожен рух, і Brain знижує агресивність сигналів.",

ai_f_vola_low: "Тому що atrRel={atrRel} (≈{atrPct}% від ціни) говорить про дуже низьку волатильність, і Brain не закладає швидких і великих рухів.",
ai_f_vola_low_v2: "Тому що при слабкій волатильності ринок часто пиляє в діапазоні, і Brain не розраховує на великий профіт за короткий час.",
ai_f_vola_low_v3: "Тому що низька vola робить тренди крихкими, і Brain обережніше ставиться до цілей і не завищує очікування по R:R.",
ai_f_vola_low_v4: "Тому що коли atrPct малий, ринок «заснув», і Brain частіше чекає пробудження волатильності, перш ніж посилювати directional-сигнали.",
ai_f_vola_low_v5: "Тому що low-vola режим збільшує ймовірність хибних пробоїв і затяжних флетів, і Brain враховує це та ріже впевненість.",

// ===== уровни / контекст =====
ai_note_sr: "Тому що найближча підтримка близько {s}, опір близько {r}, поточна ціна {price}, і через nearS={nearS} та nearR={nearR} Brain оцінює, скільки ходу лишається до рівня і де логічно ставити стоп/тейк.",
ai_note_h: "Тому що Brain враховує очікуваний хід ціни на різних горизонтах, щоб рекомендація була узгодженою в часі, а не реакцією тільки на один бар.",

// ===== дата и волатильность данных =====
ai_note_data_short_history: "Тому що історії мало (барів: {bars}), частина статистики ненадійна, і Brain знижує впевненість у сильних directional-сигналах.",
ai_note_data_short_history_v2: "Тому що при короткій історії ({bars} барів) моделі волатильності й тренду працюють грубіше, і Brain тому дає обережніші висновки.",
ai_note_data_short_history_v3: "Тому що скромний обсяг даних ускладнює оцінку ринку, і Brain не переоцінює сигнали, отримані на малій вибірці.",
ai_note_data_short_history_v4: "Тому що за нестачі історичних свічок ризик помилок у скорингу вищий, і Brain ріже впевненість у рекомендаціях.",
ai_note_data_short_history_v5: "Тому що малий обсяг історії робить будь-які висновки крихкими, і Brain чесно враховує це, не розганяючи strength сигналу.",

ai_note_data_low_vola: "Тому що зараз знижена ринкова активність (atrRel={atrRel}, ≈{atrPct}% від ціни), і Brain не чекає агресивних рухів, рекомендуючи помірні очікування.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v2: "Тому що низька активність за волатильністю робить ринок в’язким, і Brain уникає надто амбіційних цілей у таких умовах.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v3: "Тому що слабка динаміка цін — сигнал, що ринок поки не готовий до великого тренду, і Brain враховує це на користь обережної тактики.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v4: "Тому що коли vola мала, ймовірність пилки вища, і Brain не рекомендує будувати ставку на сильний swing.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v5: "Тому що ринок у режимі low-vola часто витрачає час, а не дає рух, і Brain закликає терпляче переждати фазу затишшя.",

// ===== R:R =====
ai_note_rr_good: "Тому що очікуване співвідношення ризик/прибуток {rr} при цільовому рівні {rrNominal}x виглядає привабливим, і Brain вважає таку угоду статистично виправданою.",
ai_note_rr_good_v2: "Тому що хороший R:R ({rr} проти орієнтира {rrNominal}x) дає запас по дохідності, і Brain відзначає цю угоду як цікаву за профілем ризику.",
ai_note_rr_good_v3: "Тому що при такому R:R угода компенсує окремі збиткові входи, і Brain позитивно оцінює маточікування стратегії.",
ai_note_rr_good_v4: "Тому що R:R вище орієнтирного рівня — рідкісний плюс, і Brain допускає більш активну роботу з таким сетапом.",
ai_note_rr_good_v5: "Тому що коли ризик/прибуток працює на нас (rr≈{rr}), Brain розглядає сетап як якісний навіть за неідеальної картини.",

ai_note_rr_poor: "Тому що поточне співвідношення ризик/прибуток {rr} гірше орієнтира {rrNominal}x, і Brain не рекомендує агресивно заходити в таку угоду.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v2: "Тому що слабкий R:R ({rr} при бажаному {rrNominal}x) робить ідею малоцікавою, і Brain не бачить достатнього запасу по профіту.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v3: "Тому що коли R:R не дотягує до стандарту, навіть правильний прогноз дає мало, і Brain знижує пріоритет цього входу.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v4: "Тому що погане співвідношення ризик/прибуток збільшує шанс, що серія таких угод з’їсть депозит, і Brain не заохочує систематично їх брати.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v5: "Тому що при низькому R:R Brain вважає, що краще пропустити таку можливість і дочекатися більш вигідного сетапу.",

// ===== oversold / overbought risk reversal =====
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal: "Тому що глибока перепроданість (RSI={rsi}) створює ризик різкого розвороту вгору, і Brain вважає за краще не відкривати нові шорти в такій точці.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v2: "Тому що за сильної перепроданості по RSI Brain бачить високу ймовірність short squeeze і не підштовхує до свіжих шортів.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v3: "Тому що коли ринок сильно перепроданий, будь-яка позитивна новина може викликати розворот, і Brain враховує цей ризик проти шортів.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v4: "Тому що стан oversold робить вхід у short статистично небезпечнішим, і Brain рекомендує витримати паузу.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v5: "Тому що Brain відзначає: сильна перепроданість — не найкраще місце, щоб додавати шорти, тут вищий шанс відскоку.",

ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal: "Тому що сильна перекупленість (RSI={rsi}) підвищує ризик різкого розвороту вниз, і Brain не заохочує агресивні докупівлі на вершині.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v2: "Тому що при overbought-стані по RSI Brain бачить великий ризик відкату й не вважає розумним розганяти long.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v3: "Тому що перекуплений ринок часто розвертається на новинах, і Brain враховує це, радячи не нарощувати позицію.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v4: "Тому що в зоні перекупленості статистика проти нових лонгів, і Brain визнає підвищений ризик розвороту.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v5: "Тому що Brain вважає: за сильної перекупленості краще захищати прибуток, ніж відкривати нові покупки.",

// ===== деривативы / on-chain =====
ai_note_funding: "Тому що funding={funding} показує перекіс у позиціях на деривативах, і Brain враховує, яка сторона ринку перевантажена й де вищий ризик різкого винесення.",
ai_note_funding_v2: "Тому що аномальний funding натякає на дисбаланс між long і short, і Brain сприймає це як фактор ризику проти переповненої сторони.",
ai_note_funding_v3: "Тому що через funding Brain бачить, хто переплачує за плече, і це посилює ймовірність руху проти перевантажених позицій.",
ai_note_funding_v4: "Тому що високий за модулем funding — попередження про нестійкий баланс на ф’ючерсах, і Brain знижує впевненість у продовженні поточної позабалансової сторони.",
ai_note_funding_v5: "Тому що Brain використовує funding як термометр жадібності/страху на деривативах, що допомагає не ставати в чергу разом із натовпом.",

ai_note_oi_change: "Тому що зміна Open Interest {oiChange} показує приплив/відтік грошей у ф’ючерси, і так Brain відрізняє «живий» рух від порожньої волатильності.",
ai_note_oi_change_v2: "Тому що зростання OI при русі ціни підсилює тренд-сигнал, а падіння OI його послаблює — саме так Brain читає метрику {oiChange}.",
ai_note_oi_change_v3: "Тому що через динаміку Open Interest Brain розуміє, відкриваються нові позиції чи ринок лише виносить старі.",
ai_note_oi_change_v4: "Тому що сильні зрушення OI — знак перерозподілу ризику між учасниками, і Brain використовує це для уточнення сигналу.",
ai_note_oi_change_v5: "Тому що Brain дивиться на {oiChange}, щоб не плутати істинний тренд із рухом на закритті позицій.",

ai_note_basis: "Тому що ф’ючерсний basis={basis} відображає різницю між futures і spot, і сильне відхилення говорить про перегрів однієї зі сторін, що Brain враховує в ризиках.",
ai_note_basis_v2: "Тому що атиповий basis сигналізує про перекіс очікувань на деривативах, і Brain не ігнорує цей прихований стрес-маркер.",
ai_note_basis_v3: "Тому що basis показує, наскільки ринок готовий переплачувати або дисконтувати майбутню ціну; за крайніх значень Brain обережніший.",
ai_note_basis_v4: "Тому що сильний basis у бік биків або ведмедів часто передує розворотам, і Brain враховує це, щоб не залазити в хвіст тренду.",
ai_note_basis_v5: "Тому що Brain використовує basis як індикатор довіри до тренду на ф’ючерсах, особливо коли він виходить за нормальні рівні.",

ai_note_dominance: "Тому що dominance Bitcoin близько {dominance}% показує баланс сили між BTC і альтами; за високої dominance Brain закладає тиск на альткоїни.",
ai_note_dominance_v2: "Тому що зростання BTC-dominance зазвичай погіршує умови для альтів, і Brain враховує це як зовнішній ведмежий фон для них.",
ai_note_dominance_v3: "Тому що низька dominance BTC, навпаки, відкриває вікно можливостей для альтів, і Brain коригує ризик-профіль під таку фазу.",
ai_note_dominance_v4: "Тому що через метрику dominance Brain бачить, куди стікає ліквідність — у «blue chip» BTC чи в більш ризикові активи.",
ai_note_dominance_v5: "Тому що зміни dominance допомагають Brain зрозуміти, хто зараз у фаворі в ринку — Bitcoin чи альти, і підлаштувати сигнали під цей зсув.",

ai_note_btc_corr: "Тому що кореляція з BTC близько {corr} показує, наскільки сильно актив ходить разом із Bitcoin, і Brain враховує це, щоб не дублювати один і той самий ризик.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v2: "Тому що висока кореляція з BTC означає, що доля активу значною мірою залежить від руху Bitcoin, і Brain враховує це при формуванні портфеля.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v3: "Тому що низька кореляція з BTC робить актив більш самостійним, і Brain використовує це для диверсифікації ризиків.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v4: "Тому що через кореляцію з BTC Brain оцінює, наскільки сигнал по цьому активу унікальний, а не копія BTC-пози.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v5: "Тому що зрушення в {corr} допомагають Brain зрозуміти, чи посилюється зв’язка з BTC, чи слабшає, і скоригувати очікування щодо руху.",

ai_note_global_spot: "Тому що стан глобального spot-ринку оцінюється як {globalSpot}, і Brain використовує цей фон як фільтр, підсилюючи або пом’якшуючи локальні сигнали.",
ai_note_global_spot_v2: "Тому що загальний тон spot-ринку ({globalSpot}) впливає на ймовірність успіху локального сетапу, і Brain не розглядає його відірвано від фону.",
ai_note_global_spot_v3: "Тому що якщо global spot слабкий, Brain обережніший з агресивними лонгами, навіть за хорошої локальної картини.",
ai_note_global_spot_v4: "Тому що сильний spot-фон робить бичачі сигнали надійнішими, і Brain враховує цей tailwind.",
ai_note_global_spot_v5: "Тому що Brain завжди звіряє локальний сигнал із global spot-картиною ({globalSpot}), щоб не торгувати проти загального потоку ліквідності.",

ai_note_venue_spread: "Тому що підвищений venue spread={spread} говорить про неоднорідність цін і можливі проскальзування, і Brain рекомендує більш консервативний розмір позиції.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v2: "Тому що великий спред між майданчиками — ознака зниженої ліквідності, і Brain бачить у цьому додатковий операційний ризик.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v3: "Тому що коли ціни на різних біржах сильно розходяться, зростає ризик поганих виконань, і Brain враховує це при оцінці ризику угоди.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v4: "Тому що розширений venue spread підказує Brain, що зараз не найкращий момент для великих ордерів.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v5: "Тому що Brain сприймає високий spread між біржами як сигнал пригальмувати й торгувати обережніше, щоб уникнути зайвих втрат на виконанні.",

ai_note_data_short_history_v5: "Çünkü küçük geçmiş hacmi her türlü sonucu kırılgan kılıyor ve Brain bunu dürüstçe hesaba katıp sinyal gücünü şişirmiyor.",

ai_note_data_low_vola: "Çünkü şu anda düşük piyasa aktivitesi var (atrRel={atrRel}, ≈{atrPct}% fiyattan) ve Brain agresif hareketler beklemeyerek ölçülü beklentiler öneriyor.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v2: "Çünkü volatilite açısından düşük aktivite piyasayı yapışkan hale getiriyor ve Brain böyle koşullarda aşırı iddialı hedeflerden kaçınıyor.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v3: "Çünkü zayıf fiyat dinamiği, piyasanın henüz büyük bir trende hazır olmadığı sinyalini veriyor ve Brain bunu daha temkinli bir taktik lehine değerlendiriyor.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v4: "Çünkü vola düşük olduğunda testere hareketi ihtimali daha yüksek ve Brain güçlü bir swing üzerine iddia kurmayı önermiyor.",
ai_note_data_low_vola_v5: "Çünkü low-vola modundaki piyasa çoğu zaman hareket vermek yerine zaman harcıyor ve Brain durgunluk fazını sabırla atlatmayı tavsiye ediyor.",

// ===== R:R =====
ai_note_rr_good: "Çünkü beklenen risk/ödül oranı {rr}, hedef seviye {rrNominal}x civarında cazip görünüyor ve Brain böyle bir işlemi istatistiksel olarak gerekçeli kabul ediyor.",
ai_note_rr_good_v2: "Çünkü iyi bir R:R ({rr} vs referans {rrNominal}x) getiri için bir tampon sağlıyor ve Brain bu işlemi risk profili açısından ilgi çekici olarak işaretliyor.",
ai_note_rr_good_v3: "Çünkü böyle bir R:R ile işlem, bazı zararlı girişleri telafi ediyor ve Brain stratejinin beklenen değerini olumlu değerlendiriyor.",
ai_note_rr_good_v4: "Çünkü referans seviyenin üzerindeki R:R nadir bir artı ve Brain böyle bir setup ile daha aktif çalışmaya izin veriyor.",
ai_note_rr_good_v5: "Çünkü risk/ödül (rr≈{rr}) lehimize işlediğinde Brain, tablo mükemmel olmasa bile setup’ı kaliteli olarak değerlendiriyor.",

ai_note_rr_poor: "Çünkü mevcut risk/ödül oranı {rr}, referans {rrNominal}x’ten daha kötü ve Brain bu tür bir işleme agresif girmeyi önermiyor.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v2: "Çünkü zayıf R:R ({rr}, istenen {rrNominal}x karşısında) fikri pek cazip kılmıyor ve Brain yeterli kâr marjı görmüyor.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v3: "Çünkü R:R standart seviyeye ulaşmadığında, doğru tahmin bile az kazandırıyor ve Brain bu girişin önceliğini düşürüyor.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v4: "Çünkü kötü risk/ödül oranı, bu tür işlemlerden oluşan bir serinin hesabı eritme şansını artırıyor ve Brain bunları sistematik olarak almayı teşvik etmiyor.",
ai_note_rr_poor_v5: "Çünkü düşük R:R durumunda Brain, böyle bir fırsatı pas geçip daha avantajlı bir setup beklemenin daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyor.",

// ===== oversold / overbought risk reversal =====
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal: "Çünkü derin aşırı satım (RSI={rsi}) sert bir yukarı dönüş riski yaratıyor ve Brain böyle bir noktada yeni short açmayı tercih etmiyor.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v2: "Çünkü RSI’deki güçlü aşırı satımda Brain, yüksek short squeeze olasılığı görüyor ve taze short’lara zorlamıyor.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v3: "Çünkü piyasa ciddi şekilde aşırı satımdayken, herhangi bir pozitif haber dönüş yaratabilir ve Brain bu riski short’lar aleyhine dikkate alıyor.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v4: "Çünkü oversold durumu short girişini istatistiksel olarak daha tehlikeli kılıyor ve Brain bir süre beklemeyi öneriyor.",
ai_note_oversold_risk_reversal_v5: "Çünkü Brain şunu not ediyor: güçlü aşırı satım, short eklemek için iyi bir yer değil; burada tepki ihtimali daha yüksek.",

ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal: "Çünkü güçlü aşırı alım (RSI={rsi}) sert aşağı dönüş riskini artırıyor ve Brain zirvede agresif ek alımları teşvik etmiyor.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v2: "Çünkü RSI üzerindeki overbought durumunda Brain büyük bir düzeltme riski görüyor ve long’u daha da zorlamayı mantıklı bulmuyor.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v3: "Çünkü aşırı alımda olan piyasa haberlerde sık sık döner ve Brain bunu dikkate alarak pozisyon büyütmemeyi öneriyor.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v4: "Çünkü aşırı alım bölgesinde istatistikler yeni long’lara karşı ve Brain dönüş riskinin arttığını kabul ediyor.",
ai_note_overbought_risk_reversal_v5: "Çünkü Brain’e göre, güçlü aşırı alımda yeni alımlar açmaktan ziyade kârı korumak daha iyi.",

// ===== деривативы / on-chain =====
ai_note_funding: "Çünkü funding={funding}, türev pozisyonlarında bir kaymaya işaret ediyor ve Brain piyasanın hangi tarafının aşırı yüklendiğini ve nerede sert bir tasfiye riskinin daha yüksek olduğunu dikkate alıyor.",
ai_note_funding_v2: "Çünkü anormal funding long ve short arasındaki dengesizliğe işaret ediyor ve Brain bunu kalabalık tarafa karşı bir risk faktörü olarak görüyor.",
ai_note_funding_v3: "Çünkü Brain funding üzerinden kimin kaldıraç için fazla ödediğini görüyor ve bu, aşırı dolu pozisyonlara karşı harekete geçme ihtimalini artırıyor.",
ai_note_funding_v4: "Çünkü mutlak değeri yüksek funding, vadeli piyasalarda kırılgan bir denge uyarısı ve Brain, dengesiz taraftaki trendin devamına olan güvenini azaltıyor.",
ai_note_funding_v5: "Çünkü Brain, funding’i türevlerde açgözlülük/korku termometresi olarak kullanıyor ve bu da kalabalığın kuyruğuna takılmamaya yardımcı oluyor.",

ai_note_oi_change: "Çünkü Open Interest değişimi {oiChange}, vadeli işlemlere para giriş/çıkışını gösteriyor ve Brain böylece “canlı” hareketi boş volatiliteden ayırabiliyor.",
ai_note_oi_change_v2: "Çünkü fiyat hareketiyle birlikte OI artışı trend sinyalini güçlendiriyor, OI düşüşü ise zayıflatıyor — Brain tam da bu şekilde {oiChange} metriğini okuyor.",
ai_note_oi_change_v3: "Çünkü Open Interest dinamiği üzerinden Brain, yeni pozisyonların açılıp açılmadığını ya da piyasanın sadece eski pozisyonları tasfiye edip etmediğini anlıyor.",
ai_note_oi_change_v4: "Çünkü OI’deki güçlü kaymalar, katılımcılar arasında riskin yeniden dağıtıldığına işaret ve Brain bunu sinyali netleştirmek için kullanıyor.",
ai_note_oi_change_v5: "Çünkü Brain, gerçek trendi pozisyon kapatmalardan kaynaklı hareketle karıştırmamak için {oiChange}’e bakıyor.",

ai_note_basis: "Çünkü vadeli basis={basis}, futures ve spot arasındaki farkı yansıtıyor ve güçlü bir sapma taraflardan birinin aşırı ısındığını söylüyor; Brain bunu risk hesabına dahil ediyor.",
ai_note_basis_v2: "Çünkü alışılmadık basis, türev beklentilerinde bir kaymaya işaret ediyor ve Brain bu gizli stres göstergesini göz ardı etmiyor.",
ai_note_basis_v3: "Çünkü basis, piyasanın gelecekteki fiyatı ne kadar primli ya da iskontolu fiyatlamaya hazır olduğunu gösteriyor; uç seviyelerde Brain daha temkinli oluyor.",
ai_note_basis_v4: "Çünkü boğalar veya ayılar yönünde güçlü basis, sık sık dönüşlerden önce gelir ve Brain trendin kuyruğuna binmemek için bunu hesaba katıyor.",
ai_note_basis_v5: "Çünkü Brain, basis’i özellikle normal seviyelerin dışına çıktığında vadeli işlemlerdeki trende güven göstergesi olarak kullanıyor.",

ai_note_dominance: "Çünkü Bitcoin dominance değeri {dominance}% civarında ve bu BTC ile altlar arasındaki güç dengesini gösteriyor; yüksek dominance durumunda Brain altcoin’ler üzerinde baskı öngörüyor.",
ai_note_dominance_v2: "Çünkü BTC-dominance artışı genellikle altlar için koşulları kötüleştiriyor ve Brain bunu onlar için dışsal bir ayı arka planı olarak değerlendiriyor.",
ai_note_dominance_v3: "Çünkü düşük BTC dominance tam tersine altlar için bir fırsat penceresi açıyor ve Brain risk profilini bu faza göre ayarlıyor.",
ai_note_dominance_v4: "Çünkü dominance metriği üzerinden Brain, likiditenin nereye aktığını görüyor — “blue chip” BTC’ye mi yoksa daha riskli varlıklara mı.",
ai_note_dominance_v5: "Çünkü dominance değişimleri, Brain’in şu anda piyasada kimin gözde olduğunu — Bitcoin mi yoksa altlar mı — anlamasına ve sinyalleri bu kaymaya göre ayarlamasına yardımcı oluyor.",

ai_note_btc_corr: "Çünkü BTC ile korelasyon {corr} civarında ve bu, varlığın Bitcoin ile ne kadar birlikte hareket ettiğini gösteriyor; Brain bunu aynı riski kopyalamamak için dikkate alıyor.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v2: "Çünkü BTC ile yüksek korelasyon, varlığın kaderinin büyük ölçüde Bitcoin hareketine bağlı olduğu anlamına geliyor ve Brain portföyü oluştururken bunu hesaba katıyor.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v3: "Çünkü BTC ile düşük korelasyon, varlığı daha bağımsız kılıyor ve Brain bunu riskleri çeşitlendirmek için kullanıyor.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v4: "Çünkü BTC korelasyonu üzerinden Brain, bu varlıktaki sinyalin BTC pozisyonunun bir kopyası mı yoksa gerçekten özgün mü olduğunu değerlendiriyor.",
ai_note_btc_corr_v5: "Çünkü {corr} içindeki kaymalar, Brain’in BTC ile bağın güçlenip güçlenmediğini ya da zayıflayıp zayıflamadığını anlamasına ve hareket beklentilerini buna göre ayarlamasına yardımcı oluyor.",

ai_note_global_spot: "Çünkü küresel spot piyasasının durumu {globalSpot} olarak değerlendiriliyor ve Brain bu arka planı, yerel sinyalleri güçlendiren veya yumuşatan bir filtre olarak kullanıyor.",
ai_note_global_spot_v2: "Çünkü spot piyasanın genel tonu ({globalSpot}), yerel setup’ın başarı olasılığını etkiliyor ve Brain onu arka plandan kopuk şekilde ele almıyor.",
ai_note_global_spot_v3: "Çünkü global spot zayıfsa, Brain agresif long’larda daha dikkatli oluyor, yerel tablo iyi olsa bile.",
ai_note_global_spot_v4: "Çünkü güçlü spot arka planı, boğa sinyallerini daha güvenilir kılıyor ve Brain bu tailwind’i hesaba katıyor.",
ai_note_global_spot_v5: "Çünkü Brain, yerel sinyali her zaman global spot tablosu ({globalSpot}) ile karşılaştırıyor; böylece genel likidite akışına karşı işlem yapmaktan kaçınıyor.",

ai_note_venue_spread: "Çünkü yükselmiş venue spread={spread}, fiyatların homojen olmadığını ve olası kaymalara işaret ediyor ve Brain daha temkinli bir pozisyon boyutu öneriyor.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v2: "Çünkü platformlar arasındaki büyük spread, düşük likidite işareti ve Brain bunu ek bir operasyonel risk olarak görüyor.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v3: "Çünkü farklı borsalardaki fiyatlar ciddi şekilde ayrıştığında, kötü icra riski artıyor ve Brain bunu işlemin risk değerlendirmesinde dikkate alıyor.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v4: "Çünkü genişlemiş venue spread, Brain’e şu anda büyük emirler için en iyi zaman olmadığı sinyalini veriyor.",
ai_note_venue_spread_v5: "Çünkü Brain, borsalar arasındaki yüksek spread’i yavaşlamaya ve daha dikkatli işlem yapmaya dair bir sinyal olarak algılıyor; böylece yürütme kaynaklı gereksiz kayıplardan kaçınmayı hedefliyor.",
